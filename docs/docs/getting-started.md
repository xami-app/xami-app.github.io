Welcome to the documentation site! Below you will find instructions on how to get started with the software. The guide is divided into three main sections: User, Admin, and Developer. Select the section that best fits your role.

## USER
As a user, the software is designed to be easy to use and intuitive. Follow these steps to get started:

- Interacting with Content: Browse through available content and interact with it by commenting, liking, or sharing.

## ADMIN
Admins have access to more advanced features to manage and monitor the system. Here’s how to get started:

### Admin Setup

- Notifications: Set up alerts and notifications for system events.
- Content Moderation: Set up filters or approval processes for submitted content.

### Monitoring Activities
- Use the Activity Logs to keep track of user actions, system events, and other important actions within the system.
- Generate reports based on log data to analyze usage patterns.

## DEVELOPER
Developers can extend, customize, and integrate with the software using our API and plugin system. Follow these steps to get started:

### Setting Up Development Environment
Clone the repository from GitHub: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourrepo.
```

1. Install dependencies using npm install or yarn install (depending on your package manager).
2. Ensure you have Node.js and the appropriate build tools installed for local development.

### Exploring the Codebase

The core application code is located in the src/ directory. Here you’ll find the main components, services, and utilities used by the software.

Review the README.md file in the src/ folder for specific developer instructions.

### Extending the Application

You can extend the software using plugins. Drop JAR files into the ./modules/ directory to add custom features.

Plugins can listen to events, add new API endpoints, or modify system behavior. For detailed instructions on creating plugins, refer to the Plugin Guide.

### Using the API

The API documentation provides detailed instructions on how to interact with the system programmatically.

You can access the API endpoints for user management, content interaction, and system monitoring.

Example API call to fetch user data:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.yoursoftware.com/users/{user_id}
```
### Running the Application Locally

Use `npm start` or yarn start to run the application locally for testing and development.

Access the local version of the app via http://localhost:3000.
